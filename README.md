# Junior Data Scientist Portfolio
Meet me, Augustin, an aspiring data scientist, self-taught and highly motivated. With a strong passion for math, new technology, AI, machine learning, and computer vision, I spends most of my spare time on Kaggle, experimenting with new techniques and participating in data science competitions. I'm constantly learning from YouTube tutorials, Udemy bootcamps, EDx classes and exploring the latest technologies.  As an avid programmer who is constantly learning to stay on top of the latest trends in data science I am more then qualified to be your next candidate.

## Projects
### [Project 1 - Wireless Volume Control](https://github.com/Augmaster/Augmaster.github.io/tree/main/Projects/WirelessVolumeChange)
#### Overview
The project uses a camera to track hand movements and gestures in real-time.It allows users to control their computer's volume by performing specific hand gestures.For example, getting your fingers closer can increase the volume while bringing spacing them can decrease it. The wireless nature of the project means that users can adjust their volume from a distance without having to touch their computer.
This technology could be applied to various other applications, such as smart home devices or gaming interfaces, making it a potentially useful addition to everyday life.

[MediaPipe - Hand Tracking](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker)

#### The technologies I used: 
* OpenCV to process the camera input, detecting and tracking the hand movements.
* Mediapipe  to estimate the hand landmarks, providing accurate data for gesture recognition.
* Numpy for data processing and manipulation, allowing for efficient calculation of gesture characteristics.
* Osascript to control the volume of the computer (MAC).

### [Project 2 - Emotion detection Wine reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/augustinrenard/emotion-detection-wine-review/edit)
#### Overview
The goal of this project was to develop an emotion detection model to categorize wine reviews as positive, neutral, or negative. The dataset used was a wine review database containing thousands of reviews, and two models were utilized for the analysis: Vadors and Roberta. Both models are pre-trained on large datasets and have been shown to perform well in NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis.
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of NLP techniques for emotion detection in wine reviews. The combination of lexicon-based and transformer-based models allowed for a comprehensive analysis of the emotional tone of the text. The high accuracy of the models suggests that they could be applied to other datasets with similar characteristics. Future work could involve exploring the use of additional models and fine-tuning the existing models to improve their performance.

[Hugging face Roberta model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roberta)

#### The technologies I used: 
* Pandas for data manipulation and analysis, especially for tabular data.
* NumPy for numerical computing, especially for scientific and mathematical calculations.
* Vadors model for lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool used to categorize text as positive, neutral, or negative based on a dictionary of words and their associated sentiment scores.
* Roberta model for transformer-based language model used for natural language processing tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis.
* Kaggle  for the datasets, and collaborating with other data scientists.
* Seaborn for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
